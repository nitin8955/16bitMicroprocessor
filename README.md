# 16bitMicroprocessor
A group project by  Nitin Meena, Vivek kumar,Vatsalya singh , and Mahith sai Reddy.

This project involves the design and implementation of a 16-bit microprocessor, a crucial building block in computing systems. Our 32-bit microprocessor features:

32-bit Data Path: Handles data in 32-bit chunks, allowing for efficient processing and storage of information.

Instruction Set Architecture (ISA): A well-defined set of instructions tailored for our 16-bit architecture, including arithmetic, logic, control, and data movement instructions.

Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): A comprehensive ALU capable of performing essential arithmetic and logic operations.

Control Unit: Manages the execution of instructions by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers, and memory.

Registers: A set of 16-bit registers used for temporary data storage and manipulation during instruction execution.
